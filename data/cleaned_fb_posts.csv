100,"85% of sexual assault victims in Malta do not report the crime to authorities.

What is sexual assault? It is to force someone into sexual activity when they are unwilling, using violence, threatening behaviour, power or coercion. Sexual assault does not necessarily include the act of sex and can also occur when the victim is unable to give consent. Absence of the word ‘no’, does not necessarily mean ‘yes’ and is not defined as consent.

Forms of sexual assault include rape, marital rape, child sexual abuse, elderly sexual assault, groping, kissing and sexual harassment, with all the above causing severe, often, long-lasting psychological problems with the victims such as depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. That would be in addition to the physical effects suffered such as physical trauma and unwanted pregnancies.

Many victims are invalidated, and even shamed, being told that it was their fault. This may affect how, and whether, they report what had happened to them to the authorities, either to avoid reliving the trauma of the assault or due to social stigma of being a victim.

Design: Owen Cachia","sex,rape,sexual harassment,Sexual Abuse",1
101,"Sexual assault is a punishable crime and can be defined as any form of unwanted sexual contact or behaviour that occurs without explicit consent of the recipient, this can include rape, fondling and even attempted rape. Sexual assault and/or rape are never a victim’s fault! Any individual can be a victim of sexual assault, men, women, young or old. Although incredibly common, sexual assault remains greatly underreported locally.

If you are a victim of sexual assault and would like to seek support please contact the Victim Support Malta or the Supportline on 179. If you are a victim and would like to report the assault, please contact the Victim Support Unit within the Malta Police Force.

219,"This World AIDS Day, we recognize and celebrate the generations of HIV and AIDS activists whose trailblazing work has fundamentally changed and continues to impact the political landscape of public health and the everyday lives of people living with and affected by HIV. As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, there's a lot we can learn from those affected by the HIV / AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s.

The COVID-19 pandemic was marked by government coordination and action, but those on the front lines of the HIV epidemic were treated with apathy and hostility, all while taking care of each other and grieving the loss of family, partners, and community members.

The sexual health and public health sectors owe so much to the creativity, resilience, ethics and vision of everyone in the HIV/AIDS movement. They are still on the frontlines, pushing back against stigma when it comes to HIV and STIs.

Everyone deserves to be healthy and to thrive. Knowing our HIV status is a crucial part of taking care of ourselves. This year, Health Canada approved the use of the INSTI HIV Self-Test, which allows people to receive a testing kit in the mail and take a 1-minute test from their homes. With 14% of HIV-positive Canadians still undiagnosed, this is a crucial step towards making HIV and STI testing more widely available so that everyone is able to know their status and connect with community supports and treatment. To learn more about HIV self-testing, read this update by CATIE: https://www.catie.ca/en/catienews/2020-11-04/health-canada-licenses-hiv-self-testing

Diagnosing and treating other STIs is also a key part of HIV prevention work, because STIs can make us more vulnerable to HIV infection. We all deserve access to accessible, sex positive, comprehensive sexual health information and care. It’s our right.

The over-investment in policing prevents us from raising our children in safe and sustainable communities because it deprives critical social services of the necessary funding. That's why we are joining the call for a reimagination of community safety.

Last week, on November 21, the Ottawa Police Service (OPS) intimidated and used unnecessary force over people exercising their right to protest this failure to act, arresting the demonstrators in the early morning just hours before the budget meeting, and confiscating and mishandling ceremonial and sacred Indigenous items. Shortly after this, despite over ten hours of community testimonials of clear and concise demands to reduce the police budget and invest in other services, the OPS Board approved a $13.2 million increase to the annual budget.

Across Canada, cities like Ottawa have created few impartial spaces for community voices to be heard during budget decision-making. Often, these spaces are moderated by the Chair of the Police Board or others with a strong interest in maintaining the status quo.

COVID-19 has changed everything, but unfair immigration rules stay the same. Current and former international students are running out of time. Thousands face deportation after December 31st if we don’t fulfill requirements for permanent residency that are out of our control.

Migrant student workers must complete 12-24 months of high-waged work to qualify for permanent residency. However, with COVID-19 related job losses worsening again in the second wave, most do not have access to these jobs and yet our permits remain non-renewable and are set to expire.

Time has been stolen from us, and the consequences of inaction will be devastating. Minister Mendicino: Make work permits renewable. Value all work for permanent residency. Ensure full and permanent status for all. Don’t punish migrant workers for the pandemic.

Migrant student workers must complete 12-24 months of high-waged work to qualify for permanent residency. However, with COVID-19 related job losses worsening again in the second wave, most do not have access to these jobs and yet our permits remain non-renewable and are set to expire.

Time has been stolen from us, and the consequences of inaction will be devastating. Minister Mendicino: Make work permits renewable. Value all work for permanent residency. Ensure full and permanent status for all. Don’t punish migrant workers for the pandemic.

MAKE SURE HE HEARS US! Call Minister Mendicino at 416-781-5583 or 613-992-6361 and demand that he make work permits renewable and ensure #StatusForAll. Script here: https://www.facebook.com/MigrantWorkersAlliance/posts/3559842924095415

📌 Home is not the safest place for a woman. In the wake of COVID-19, there has been a surge in gender-based violence and the issue of femicide has assumed greater urgency. An increase in the number of calls to domestic violence helplines across many countries stand testimony to this.

📌 Women protesting against femicide in public spaces have been threatened with violence, fired at by state actors, physically assaulted, and killed. We strongly condemn such acts of violence and brutality in public spaces.

📌 Governments must do more to protect women from femicide in private and public spaces. Their inaction results in impunity and women are paying the price with their lives. The time for change is NOW!
