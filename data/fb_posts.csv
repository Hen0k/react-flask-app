➡️ A mammogram can be described as taking an x-ray picture of your breasts, and is very important in finding cancer early. Remember that the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to screening, it is better to detect any lumps early rather than not detecting them at all!

Women between the ages of 50-69 are eligible for screening as part of the National Screening programme. If you feel or see any changes in your breasts that you are concerned about speak to your family doctor.

You may also contact the Mater Dei Hospital Breast clinic on 25454573 or 25454433!"
0,4,0,"Think Pink!💗

Our next theme in our Pink October Campaign is 'Breast Self-Examination'. Self-examining your breasts can be an important way to detect any lumps, hence detecting any possible cancerous lumps, early on. It is a very useful and important screening tool that should be performed in combination with the regular mammograms, and physical examination by your doctor.

This self-exam should be made part of your regular routine, and should be performed at least once a month. Regular examination will make you more familiar with what your breasts are like normally, so if a lump is present it will be noticed easily.

Do not hesitate to call your doctor if you've noticed a lump or any other breast changes👩‍⚕️

Learn more on how to self-examine your breasts down below⬇️

Yearly, the month of October is dedicated to raising awareness on breast cancer and is known as 'Pink October'. To kickstart our Pink October Campaign we will be focusing on the signs or symptoms and risk factors associated with breast cancer.

What are signs and symptoms?
➡️ A sign is normally something that the doctor will notice, whilst a symptom is normally something the patient will notice.

What is a risk factor?
➡️ A risk factor may refer to particular characteristics an individual has that makes them more likely to develop disease.

Learn more about the specific signs or symptoms and risk factors associated with breast cancer down below⬇️

0,37,0,"85% of sexual assault victims in Malta do not report the crime to authorities.

What is sexual assault? It is to force someone into sexual activity when they are unwilling, using violence, threatening behaviour, power or coercion. Sexual assault does not necessarily include the act of sex and can also occur when the victim is unable to give consent. Absence of the word ‘no’, does not necessarily mean ‘yes’ and is not defined as consent.

Forms of sexual assault include rape, marital rape, child sexual abuse, elderly sexual assault, groping, kissing and sexual harassment, with all the above causing severe, often, long-lasting psychological problems with the victims such as depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. That would be in addition to the physical effects suffered such as physical trauma and unwanted pregnancies.

Many victims are invalidated, and even shamed, being told that it was their fault. This may affect how, and whether, they report what had happened to them to the authorities, either to avoid reliving the trauma of the assault or due to social stigma of being a victim.

Design: Owen Cachia"
0,7,7,"Sexual assault is a punishable crime and can be defined as any form of unwanted sexual contact or behaviour that occurs without explicit consent of the recipient, this can include rape, fondling and even attempted rape. Sexual assault and/or rape are never a victim’s fault! Any individual can be a victim of sexual assault, men, women, young or old. Although incredibly common, sexual assault remains greatly underreported locally.

If you are a victim of sexual assault and would like to seek support please contact the Victim Support Malta or the Supportline on 179. If you are a victim and would like to report the assault, please contact the Victim Support Unit within the Malta Police Force.

Looking back on the past year, it was a term of many firsts for MMSA SCORA - namely its first student abortion debate, its first fundraising and awareness event for the LGBTIQ+ community, and its first publication related to maternal health, MATERNA! Together with the usual events which stick to our ethos, such as World AIDS Day and the highly successful Peer Ed campaign in Sixth Forms and Secondary schools, SCORA was successful in creating awareness on topics which face much discrimination and are greatly tabooed in today's society. It has become increasingly evident that SCORA's work, now more than ever has become highly relevant and it shall keep up its work for the new term! Whilst thanking the past SCORA Officer, Andy Coleiro and her hard working team for their work in the past term, we now welcome Mick Zammit, the new SCORA Officer and her team for the term 2020-2021! Watch this space to keep up to date with SCORA's work for the term! Happy Summer!"

This year’s Medicolegal Conference organised by ELSA Malta and MMSA was held on the 29th February 2020 where students from the faculties of Law and Medicine joined to discuss Reproductive Rights, highlighting a number of topics namely IVF, Embryo Freezing, Surrogacy and Contraceptive Rights.

Guest speakers Prof. Jean Calleja Agius, Dr.Martina Pace and Dr.Andreana Dibben put across their thoughts on the subject through a panel discussion, which was followed by a series of small group case workshops in which participants were given the chance to voice their opinion.

Did you know that out of the 211 million estimated pregnancies that occur in the world, 40% are unwanted pregnancies? 50% of these unwanted pregancies then end in abortion, often in unsafe conditions.

0,2,0,"This World AIDS Day, we recognize and celebrate the generations of HIV and AIDS activists whose trailblazing work has fundamentally changed and continues to impact the political landscape of public health and the everyday lives of people living with and affected by HIV. As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, there's a lot we can learn from those affected by the HIV / AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s.

The COVID-19 pandemic was marked by government coordination and action, but those on the front lines of the HIV epidemic were treated with apathy and hostility, all while taking care of each other and grieving the loss of family, partners, and community members.

The sexual health and public health sectors owe so much to the creativity, resilience, ethics and vision of everyone in the HIV/AIDS movement. They are still on the frontlines, pushing back against stigma when it comes to HIV and STIs.

Everyone deserves to be healthy and to thrive. Knowing our HIV status is a crucial part of taking care of ourselves. This year, Health Canada approved the use of the INSTI HIV Self-Test, which allows people to receive a testing kit in the mail and take a 1-minute test from their homes. With 14% of HIV-positive Canadians still undiagnosed, this is a crucial step towards making HIV and STI testing more widely available so that everyone is able to know their status and connect with community supports and treatment. To learn more about HIV self-testing, read this update by CATIE: https://www.catie.ca/en/catienews/2020-11-04/health-canada-licenses-hiv-self-testing

Diagnosing and treating other STIs is also a key part of HIV prevention work, because STIs can make us more vulnerable to HIV infection. We all deserve access to accessible, sex positive, comprehensive sexual health information and care. It’s our right.

The over-investment in policing prevents us from raising our children in safe and sustainable communities because it deprives critical social services of the necessary funding. That's why we are joining the call for a reimagination of community safety.

Last week, on November 21, the Ottawa Police Service (OPS) intimidated and used unnecessary force over people exercising their right to protest this failure to act, arresting the demonstrators in the early morning just hours before the budget meeting, and confiscating and mishandling ceremonial and sacred Indigenous items. Shortly after this, despite over ten hours of community testimonials of clear and concise demands to reduce the police budget and invest in other services, the OPS Board approved a $13.2 million increase to the annual budget.

Across Canada, cities like Ottawa have created few impartial spaces for community voices to be heard during budget decision-making. Often, these spaces are moderated by the Chair of the Police Board or others with a strong interest in maintaining the status quo.

COVID-19 has changed everything, but unfair immigration rules stay the same. Current and former international students are running out of time. Thousands face deportation after December 31st if we don’t fulfill requirements for permanent residency that are out of our control.

Migrant student workers must complete 12-24 months of high-waged work to qualify for permanent residency. However, with COVID-19 related job losses worsening again in the second wave, most do not have access to these jobs and yet our permits remain non-renewable and are set to expire.

Time has been stolen from us, and the consequences of inaction will be devastating. Minister Mendicino: Make work permits renewable. Value all work for permanent residency. Ensure full and permanent status for all. Don’t punish migrant workers for the pandemic.

✊ We Shall be Silent No More:
We Signed up for Domestic Labor, Not Domestic Abuse

✅ Read IDWF full statement: https://bit.ly/201125DWnotDA

On the International Day to End Violence Against Women, we think of women workers, who are the predominant population engaged in domestic work, paid, underpaid, and unpaid.

Under COVID-19, people are asked to abide by social isolation, but for domestic workers, domestic confinement transforms to domestic abuse. Because of the nature of their work, domestic workers are often forced into silence when they experience violence and abuse at the hands of their employers.

The IDWF demands that solid measures are taken by governmental agencies and civil societies alike, to ensure the respect and recognition of the human, labor, and women rights of the workers.

✊ It is Domestic Work, Not Domestic Violence.

✊ Under COVID-19,
It is Domestic Confinement Not Domestic Abuse.

🌍 In 1991, the Global 16 Days Campaign (Nov 25 to Dec 10) was launched by Center for Women's Global Leadership with feminists from different parts of the world at its first Women’s Global Leadership Institute, to AFFIRM and RECOGNIZE that women's rights are human rights!

📌 Since then, we have been joined by over 6000+ organizations in more than 185 countries and the Campaign has been used effectively by UN entities, grassroots women’s organizations, NGO & governments to raise awareness, demand accountability and showcase progress on eliminating gender-based violence (GBV).

📌 Nearly three decades later, we are in the midst of a public health, economic and labor crisis which has hit millions of women across the world. The surge in domestic violence cases across the world in the wake of COVID-19 speaks to the unfinished business of eliminating GBV.
